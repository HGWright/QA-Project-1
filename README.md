# QA-Project-1

#### Introduction

The brief for this project was to make an application with CRUD functionality

The MVP for this Project includes:

* CRUD Functionality
* Website for application
* Relational Databases
* Risk Assessment
* Trello Board
* Automated Tests
* Implimented into github

To meet these requirements I have decided to make a digital library to store all of the books I am reading and have read.

##### Risk Assessment

Below you can see a detailed risk assessment. I have considered a number of risks, implemented control measures for them and them reassessed the risks once the control measures were implemented.

##### Trello Board

Here is a link to my trello board, using user stories and the AGILE framework I have created and completes a Sprint Backlog to meet all of the requirements of the MVP.
